basement and wheeling it into the back yard., 'dick2'], [But for a forty-year-old man he had done, 'dick2'], [okay., 'dick2'], [Janet could get a new vase with the money he had saved; and he liked the idea of repairing the foundations himself!, 'dick2'], [It was getting dark., 'dick2'], [The setting sun cast long rays over the scurrying commuters, tired and grim-faced, women loaded down with bundles and packages, students swarming home from the university, mixing with clerks and businessmen and drab secretaries., 'dick2'], [He stopped his Packard for a red light and then started it up again., 'dick2'], [The store had been open without him; he'd arrive just in time to spell the help for dinner, go over the records of the day, maybe even close a couple of sales himself., 'dick2'],

his breath and swung the car in a U-turn., 'dick2'], [Again he passed the little square of green with its lonely drinking fountain and bench and single lamppost., 'dick2'], [From the lamppost something was hanging., 'dick2'], [A shapeless dark bundle, swinging a little with the wind., 'dick2'], [Like a dummy of some sort., 'dick2'], [Loyce rolled down his window and peered out., 'dick2'],
